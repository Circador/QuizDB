# Future Features

Here are supplementary features I'd like to add over time, organized roughly by priority and nearness of release.

(**Voice your opinions!**) If there are features you'd like to see, or you'd like to see some of these sooner, [contact me](/about#contact)!

- Improved question formatting for powers and answerlines. (The issue here is that, ultimately, questions have to be manually marked to display things like bold and underline. It's a high priority, but it'll be slow.)
  - Improved tagging and categorization for question content. I'm going to try to use some smart parsing to do this, but it may end up being a knees-in-the-mud manual effort.
- Advanced "google-style" search, allowing you to do things like "do NOT include" or "includes any of the following."
- Offline support using cached data of the most popular and high quality questions.
- Interactive charts and statistics showing answer distribution and quality over time. (I imagine it'll be useful for seeing which way the winds are blowing with stock clues.)
- **Moxon**, a live question reader.
  - With an actual AI, developed from [QANTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2kGD1EdfFw) research, playing against you!
- User accounts, with:
  - Starring questions & packets, and viewing/filtering starred questions.
  - Creating memory cards and notes using live highlighting
  - Tracking questions read (or at least searched for)
- Improved appearance customization, with dark themes and font customization.
- Who knows..?
